# Ariel Training - or - How to get away with good Audio Recordings

## Introduction
Recording your voice properly is crucial for producing high-quality audio content. This guide will walk you through the essential steps and tips to ensure your recordings are clear and professional.

## Equipment Needed
- **Microphone**: Choose a good quality microphone. If you have a crapy microphone, don't waste your time recording yourself.

Here are some samples for good audio recordings:

- **Headphones**: Usually headphones are not good enough in audio quality.
- **Recording Software**: Examples include Audacity, Adobe Audition, etc. I would suggest you use audacity. [Here is a tutorial how to record audio](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_recording_computer_playback_on_windows.html).

## Setting Up Your Recording Space

- **Quiet Environment**: Choose a quiet room with minimal background noise.
- **Microphone Placement**: Position the microphone at a proper distance from your mouth. Record some sample audios beforehand to verify the quality.

## Recording Tips

- **Maintain Consistent Volume**: Speak at a consistent volume throughout the recording.

## What to do after i finished recording?

You have two options:

1. You let us do everything! Just send us the audio files however you want.
2. You can decide a few things:
- Give your speaker a name! (Choose whatever you want - as long as it has not been used before)
- You can create an image for your own character if you want.
- Upload the data to our Google Drive:  /4_Technique/02_TTS/data_tts/Data/{your_speaker_name}


## Audio Lines to Record

> Intonation: Try speak with as much intonation as possible. Make sure it doesn't sound as being read.

> Recordings: Separate every emotion in at least one separate file. You can also have multiple files for one emotion if you want to interrupt the process of recording. Make sure to name the files accordingly e.g. "surprise_1".

> You don't need to read every line, if it is too much for you. The more the better, but if you skip a line, don't worry about it.

> Make sure to stop between each line for 1-2 seconds.

> Be creative! If you have fun ideas for sentences, just say whatever you want. You can also add natural sounds whenever you want e.g. Clearing Throat, Shouting ...
